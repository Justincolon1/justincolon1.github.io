          <p>When you live in New York there is a place everyone wants to go to like time square or SoHo. What New Yorkers don’t know is that when you go to Uptown, that’s where you’ll really see the heart of New York. Uptown Manhattan is not exactly like Times Square or Soho where the rich, wealthy, and all the expensive name-brand clothing reside. I mean who wouldn’t want to go to a store like Bape, Ksubi, and more. In Uptown, I can guarantee you will feel so much better there than in a crowded place like Times square where everyone goes in the afternoon. I can’t say for certain that people who are not from New York will feel it, but true New Yorkers will definitely feel the vibe that Uptown is like the heart of New york. When you get to uptown you might think that it has a Hispanic environment because all these people have a certain face that makes them look Dominican or Puerto Rican. As well as the bodegas and haircut shops they owned! It’s really one or the other when going around there. </p>
          <p>Every twice a week I go to work with my dad to get a haircut and just chill with my dad for a day. One day when I got to work with my dad to get my haircut I got hungry, so I went by myself around the corner to the deli and ordered a bacon egg and cheese on a roll. When I enter the deli I notice almost everyone in the store is like a Hispanic descendant I mean I am too. So when I’m about to order the guy at the stove asks me “Que Tu Quiere Papi.” I was so brain dead that I didn't say anything, but a few seconds after I had realized that he was asking me what I wanted, I just ordered a bacon egg and cheese on a roll. That whole time I was just watching him go to work on the stove that looked so burnt. He just started breaking the eggs, throwing the rolls into the toaster like a real pro. It was satisfying to watch until I heard him start moving everything with this knife in his hand to help him move the things on the stove that had such a bad screeching noise so I left the cooking section to get my Bev. Obviously, I had to get a red Gatorade because I thought it was the best drink of all time. Which I now know is a lie. When I came back to see the progress on my food I saw him cut down the bread in half with all the cheese dripping down the buns, in my head I’m thinking how the hell am I going to eat after this. Well, nothing is impossible when you live in a Hispanic family that makes rice and beans almost every day of the week. After cooking the meal he wrapped up my sandwich in tinfoil with the weird paper bag below it. I finally paid for it and left the bodega. New Yorkers know when the cheese is dripping down to the buns on a bacon egg and cheese they got a full day ahead of them.</p>
          <p>You know when you live in a big city, of course, you’re going to get a sense of style, like when you take a walk around Uptown at two you will see all types of clothing people wear. Some people might wear an all-black Nike sweatsuit with some white air forces, others might dress in cargo pants with the new Jordan 1 Mochas. In uptown, I go to a store in the same place called UPNYC to get clothes that I genuinely wear a lot. This place has a variety of clothing you could wear. If you find New Yorkers who follow up on places like this that have Nike, Jordans, and stuff like that they can certify that this place is the real deal. If there’s one thing about New Yorkers when it comes to our style they definitely have the best drip (clothes). This is really what emulates us from other places we are fashionistas when it comes to things like this.</p>
